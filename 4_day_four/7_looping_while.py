# Create a While Loop that subtracts one by one the numbers from 50 to 0
# (both numbers included) with the following additional conditions:
# If the number is divisible by 5, show that number on the screen
# (remember that here you can use the modulus operation dividing by 5 and
# checking the remainder!)
# If the number is not divisible by 5, continue executing the loop without
# showing the value on the screen (don't forget to continue subtracting so
# that the program doesn't run infinitely).

number = 50

while number >= 0:
    if number % 5== 0:
        print(number)
    else:
        pass
    number -= 1
