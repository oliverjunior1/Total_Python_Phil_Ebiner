# Declare a function called square, that takes any number as an argument, and each time it is called, it prints the square of that
# number on the screen (that is, the value to the second power).
def square(number):
    print(number**2)

# The name of the argument that this function must take is number. Create this variable and assign it any number.
number = 9
# You should only define the function and create the variable, you should not call the function afterwards.
